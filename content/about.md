Hi,
my name is Jan, also known as *smittie* sometimes.

I'm holding a bachelor degree in media engineering and am currently enrolled
in a masters program for media related computer science in dÃ¼sseldorf, germany.

When I'm not hacking into my keyboard writing code in Java, TypeScript, Python or Clojure,
I like to...

>    ...spend time with my wife and our beloved espresso machine.
>
>    ...follow my passion for jazz music on guitar or piano.
>
>    ...keep my coffee game high with my espresso machine or chemex filter.
>
>    ...read articles or books about clean code, functional programming or philosphic topics.
>
>    ...tweak my programming and system setup on Linux or OSX.
>
>    ...do sports like Crossfit or LesMills.
>
>    ...have good chats about all of the above mentioned.
