Hi,
my name is Jan, also known as *smittie* sometimes.

I studied media technology and media informatics in Germany, DÃ¼sseldorf.

Programming and the automation of provisioning and deployment do especially interest me these days.
I also like the topic of text editors and workflow improvement.

When I'm not working on such things I also like to...

>    ...spend time with my wife and our beloved espresso machine.
>
>    ...follow my passion for jazz music on guitar.
>
>    ...read articles or books about clean code, functional programming or philosophic topics.
>
>    ...tweak my programming and system setup on Linux or OSX.
>
>    ...do sports like Crossfit, [GMB][1] or LesMills.
>
>    ...have good chats about all of the above mentioned.

For more details on my working experience, head over to my [LinkedIn][2].
